# BLE-Data-Exfiltration

Set your "server" (any Windows System, BLE had issues for me with connecting to the service when running within a VM) to developer mode

After installing the UWP App:
1) Set your Windows into "Developer Mode"

3) Allow the UWP App to store local files (Details see chapter settings: https://www.jasongaylord.com/blog/2021/11/17/uwp-file-access-denied).
